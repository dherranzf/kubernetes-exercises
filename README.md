# Kubernetes Exercises 🔧⚙️

Welcome to the **Kubernetes Exercises** repo! This is your playground to tinker with Kubernetes and get hands-on experience. Here's a quick overview of what you'll find in each folder:

## 📁 blue-and-green-deploy
Contains two deployment versions (V1 and V2) for an app called `app-alpha-back`. This setup is for practicing blue-green deployments, where you can switch between two versions of the app without any downtime. There's also a service file (`service.yaml`) to define how to access the app.

## 📁 canary-deploy
Similar to the blue-and-green folder, this one has two deployment versions (V1 and V2) for the same app `app-alpha-back`. However, this setup is for canary deployments, where you roll out a new version to a small percentage of users first. Includes a service file (`service.yaml`).

## 📁 networks
Contains a network policy (`np-egress-podselector.yaml`) that defines egress rules to control outgoing traffic from pods in the `project-alpha` namespace.

## 📄 .gitignore
Specifies which files and folders should be ignored by Git, such as compiled files, logs, and other temporary files.

## 📄 README.md
The file you're reading right now. 😊

Feel free to add more deployment configurations, network policies, or anything else related to Kubernetes that you want to experiment with. Happy tinkering!
